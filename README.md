A repository for an open source violin rest. Intended to be customizable and made for indivdual users. Process involves 3d scanning the user's shoulder for a precise contour.

As of now, it is intended to me mostly 3d printed, with limited m4 hardware. Considerations for machining or routing have not been made. (maybe in the future?)

Originally designed as a school project, we'll see where this goes!
